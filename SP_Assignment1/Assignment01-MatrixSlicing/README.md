# Matrix Slicing in Python

This project implements 2D matrix slicing in Python and Java languages. It includes methods for slicing a matrix, displaying the result, and also visually demonstrating the sliced matrix through a graphical image.

## Problem Statement

The task is to implement a program that slices a 2D matrix and displays the sliced portion of the matrix on terminal and graphically. To verify the results of slicing operation implemented in both languages, hraphical representation of matrix slicing has been provided.

### Features:
- Asks user input for a 2D matrix.
- Prompts the user to specify row and column indices to slice the matrix.
- Displays the sliced matrix both in the terminal and through a graphical interface.

## Graphical Matrix Slicing Implementation on Java
Java inplementation of matrix slicing utilizes JFrame class from Swing library to represent matrix slicing graphically. Displayer method can be called from main class to visualize the sliced matrix.

## Graphical Matrix Slicing Implementation on Python
This project uses Python's tkinter library to display the matrix graphically. The sliced part of the matrix is highlighted for user validation.
